# ShinyHunterToolKit

## Overview
ShinyHunterToolKit is a tool for shiny hunting in Pok√©mon games on emulators. It uses ImGui for the user interface, GLFW for window management, GLEW for OpenGL extension loading, and ViGEm for virtual gamepad emulation.

Only supports XInput devices, i.e., Xbox controllers.
